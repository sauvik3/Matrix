2. Matrix Subtraction
3. Matrix Multiplication
4. Scalar Matrix Multiplication
5. Scalar Matrix Division
6. Matrix Determinant
7. Matrix Transpose
8. Matrix Cofactor
9. Matrix Adjoint
10. Matrix Inverse

Operations are implemented using intitutive Operator Overloading
and generic constructs.

Usage
-------------------------------------------------------

To use the library in your program, you must build it and include
